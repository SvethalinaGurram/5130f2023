PROJECT TITLE : Credit Power-Up

In our first week of project implementation, so far we have achieved initializing the process of data collection and simultaneously we integrated datasets which brought us a bit closer to the data repository. We have also identified the stages of data analysis related to the credit factors. There were problems faces like the quality of data being poor and we had to clean it. There we were some issues in permission access too and it slowed our data acquisition process. Our primary focus will be on continuing data integration and cleaning the data to get a refined version for our data sources.

We used sql for our database formatting and we drew an sql diagram for it too.
