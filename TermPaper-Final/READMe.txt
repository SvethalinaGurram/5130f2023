Title: Web APIs and RESTful Services

Abstract:
This paper presents the development process for creating a RESTful web API for accessing transportation data. The project originated from the need for public transit data in a standardized, machine-readable format. After evaluating different API design methods, a REST architecture was selected for its scalability, flexibility, and widespread adoption. The system was built incrementally by first establishing core endpoints for routes and schedules before expanding to real-time arrival data and user features. Challenges faced included modeling complex transit data, balancing performance and scalability, and selecting frameworks for rapid development. The resulting API serves real-time public transportation information for over 5 million transit riders across a major metropolitan region. This paper provides practical insights into architecting real-world web APIs.
