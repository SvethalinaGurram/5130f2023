PROJECT TITLE : Credit Power-Up

Report:
Problem Statement:
The document outlines plans for developing a new web-based e-commerce system to facilitate online retail transactions. The goal is to build a user-friendly platform that enables customers to easily search for, purchase, and review products, while providing administrators tools to manage inventory, orders, and customer reviews.

Alternative Approaches:
Potential approaches for developing the platform include:
1) Building a custom solution from scratch using Java technologies like Spring MVC and Hibernate. This offers flexibility but requires significant development effort.  
2) Using an open-source e-commerce platform like Magento or WooCommerce. This leverages existing code but has less flexibility.
3) Purchasing a proprietary software product from a vendor. This simplifies implementation but incurs licensing fees.

Chosen Approach: 
The document outlines plans to develop a custom solution using Java technologies including Servlets, JSP, JDBC, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Reasons this approach was selected include:
1) Ability to fully customize features and functionality to exact business needs
2) Leveraging the power and widespread adoption of Java for web applications
3) Support for modern architectural approaches like MVC to aid extensibility 
4) Cost savings relative to purchasing proprietary software
5) More control compared to open source solutions with hardcoded features
The goal is to develop an intuitive, user-friendly application providing all required e-commerce capabilities. The use of standard Java frameworks aligned with MVC principles aims to achieve a flexible foundation for current needs with ability to adapt to future business requirements.



Launch instructions:
1) Provision infrastructure - Install and configure Linux, Tomcat, MySQL on on-prem or cloud infrastructure 
2) Deploy WAR file - Deploy generated WAR file from build process to Tomcat webapps folder
3) Database setup - Create schema, tables, seed data based on application data model
4) Configure app - Update configuration files, access credentials, connection URLs etc.
5) Smoke testing - Validate deployment, connectivity across app layers, basic functionality.
