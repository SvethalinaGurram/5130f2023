Title: Web APIs and RESTful Services

Abstract:
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of public REST web service APIs, highlighting their adherence to REST architectural principles and best practices. The main contributions are to provide an in-depth review of the characteristics and practical applications of these APIs, thereby providing invaluable insights into the  web services landscape. Notable contributions include identifying real-world use cases, emphasizing the flexibility and adaptability of public APIs, and observing emerging trends, such as broad support widely used for  JSON data format. Additionally, it highlights the importance of adhering to industry best practices by revealing that only 0.8% of these services strictly adhere to all REST principles. These findings are of particular importance to practitioners because they guide them in designing and implementing higher quality web services, and identify important research areas for  advancement of web services technology.
